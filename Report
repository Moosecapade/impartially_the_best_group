Problem Description 
  
In this section, describe the problem you are solving and the functionalities of your program to solve the problem. 
  The main purpose of our program is to solve the problem of finding the shortest route between two predetermined points.  A user will enter the two letter abbreviations of two cities and the program will calculate the shortest path between those two cities.
  The program will display an ordered list of the cities a person will need to visit to reach their intended destination in the shortest possible path.
  The program has an additional function of displaying fun facts about the starting city and destination city like population size and elevation.

Program Design  

Describe the overall design of your program.  

    What algorithm did you choose for implementing the shortest path problem? Why this algorithm is applicable here?  
    What classes do you use or add? Why do you choose to use those classes?  

System Implementation  

Describe the details of your implementations. Did you run into problems in your implementation? How did you overcome those problems?
