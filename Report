Problem Description 
  
In this section, describe the problem you are solving and the functionalities of your program to solve the problem. 
  The main purpose of our program is to solve the problem of finding the shortest route between two predetermined points.  A user will enter the two letter abbreviations of two cities and the program will calculate the shortest path between those two cities.
  The program will display an ordered list of the cities a person will need to visit to reach their intended destination in the shortest possible path.
  The program has an additional function of displaying fun facts about the starting city and destination city like population size and elevation.

Program Design  

Describe the overall design of your program.  

    What algorithm did you choose for implementing the shortest path problem? Why this algorithm is applicable here?  
    What classes do you use or add? Why do you choose to use those classes?  
      The algorithm we used to find the shortest path is Dijkstra's Algorithm. This algorithm was applicable because it finds the shortest path
      for every city based on a starting city. Since the user enters a starting and ending city, this algorithm can be used to find the shortest
      path from the starting city to every other city. 
      The classes we used are a Graph class, Vertex class, and Heap class. The Graph class is used to represent the cities and the connections
      between cities. It consist of vertices which are cities and edges which are the roads connecting cities. The Vertex class is used to 
      store information about a city including its index in the graph, name, city code, population, elevation, distance from a starting city, what the 
      previous city in the shortest path is, and whether it has been visited in Dijkstra's algorithm. The Vertex class is used in both
      the Graph class and Heap class. In the Graph class, the Vertex class is used to represent cities. In the Heap class, the Vertex class
      is the element being stored inside the Heap. The Heap class is a minimum Heap and is used to create a priority queue of cities based on
      their distance from a starting city. The Heap class is used in Dijkstra's algorithm as part of the implementation.
